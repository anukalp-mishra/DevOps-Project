Ansible is a tool that helps you automate tasks on remote servers.

You can use it to do things like:

Install software (e.g., Apache, MySQL)

Create users

Deploy applications

Copy configuration files

Restart services

And you donâ€™t need to install anything on the remote servers. Ansible connects using SSH (like when you ssh into a server).
